<h1>Clipsmate</h1>
<p>Clipsmate is a CRUD application with a growing suite of simple productivity tools. The original purpose of the application is to provide users with a platform where they can create text templates, which are referred to as "clips". These clips can be quickly accessed, edited, and copied when needed, thus saving time when crafting emails or Slack messages with repetitive phrasing.

The application has been designed to mimic a real SaaS company's website and application. This means that the interface and user experience of the application have been carefully constructed to resemble that of a professional product that users would expect from an established software provider.</p>
